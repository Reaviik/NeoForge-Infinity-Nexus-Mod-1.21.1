# Recycle

## Info
- The Recycler has a single purpose, to destroy any item and hopefully transform it into Residual Matter.
- Residual Matter can be used to increase the efficiency of [Matter Condenser](matter_condenser.md).
- The chance of producing Residual Matter increases according to the machine's level, starting at 5%.
