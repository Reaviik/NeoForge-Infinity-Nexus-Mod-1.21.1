# Miner Level 1 Ores

## Tip
- The miner can only mine ores relative to the installed component.
- The miner will find a random ore inside the structure to mine and break it with a <ItemImage id="minecraft:netherite_pickaxe" /> Netherite Pickaxe if you do not have a pickaxe in the enchant slot.
- The pickaxe can be enchanted with any enchantment, but Silk Touch may not work if the config is set to false.
- The miner mines ores as [IN] "376b0492-4386-40ec-8907-2124f2d65823" Fake Player.
